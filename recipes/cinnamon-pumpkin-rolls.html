    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I love cinnamon rolls, and thought it would be fun to add pumpkin and eggnog to a cinnamon roll recipe I already had for the fall season.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup eggnog</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons ground cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm 1/2 cup eggnog in a small saucepan over low heat until it bubbles, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup pumpkin; stir until melted. Add water and let mixture cool until lukewarm, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine cooled eggnog mixture, 1 cup flour, white sugar, egg, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Stir well to combine. Stir in remaining flour 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition with an electric mixer until dough has pulled together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12x9-inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice together in a bowl. Spread melted butter on top of dough and top with brown sugar mixture. Roll dough into a log, using a little water to seal the seam.</li>
        <li>Cut roll into 12 slices using a very sharp knife or a piece of unflavored dental floss. Place rolls into a 9x13-inch greased baking pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup pumpkin, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Add eggnog gradually until frosting reaches a spreadable consistency. Spread frosting over warm cinnamon rolls.</li>
    </ol>
